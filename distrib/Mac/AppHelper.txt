Do the following to launch the app for the *first* time.  Perform a
right-click (hold down the "control" key while clicking with the one
button mouse or trackpad) on the "3De" icon which is a black screen
with the word "exec" in green.  A menu should pop-up.  Select "Open
With" and from there pick "Terminal.app" which should be the default.
Depending upon the version of your Mac's operating system, you'll get
a pop-up asking if you really want to run this app from an unknown
developer.  Confirm that you do and supply the necessary username and
password if asked.  From this point on, the app will be trusted and
you can just double click on the icon to launch it.

When the app starts, it first opens up a terminal window and some text
will fly by.  But very quickly the app's GUI will appear, hiding the
terminal window.  Use the app as you normally would use any Mac app --
you can ignore the terminal window which will automatically disappear
when you exit the app.
